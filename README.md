# Feudal
I've been wanting to play around with an immediate-mode gui for a while, I need practice with networking, and I want to play [this out of print board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/847/feudal), so I'll try to implement it in LÖVE instead of buying a copy.

Check the BGG link above for pdf copy of rules but it looks like it's a cross between chess and fire emblem and that sounds awesome.

You'll need [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) and [love-imgui](https://github.com/slages/love-imgui/releases).

Once you've got your `imgui.so` / `imgui.dll` either in the game's directory or in `~/.local/share/love` / `%AppData%\LOVE` you should be able to run it by pointing love at the game's directory.
